**Paper Title**:*GoSports Foundation: Going Beyond The Gold*
**Co-author**: Dr. Sanjeev Tripathi, IIM Indore

GoSports Foundation is a non-profit venture that developed India's emerging athletic talent through athletic scholarships and other supports that helped the athletes achieve sports excellence. The foundation had limited funding and numerous applicants, requiring that it carefully choose the athletes it would support. Nandan Kamath, a co-founder of the organization, has to choose one athlete from several applicants for support. He also has to decide whether the foundation should start supporting the development of coaches and trainers and how it should balance its support with a desire to advance the profile of athletes competing in the Paralympics.

Although the BSC has been adapted for non-profit organizations, the relevance and applicability of the tool specific to India's sports sector remain an unexplored area. The purpose of this study is to scan the existing literature on the usage of BSC in managing the performance of non-profit sports organizations, then examine the challenges and opportunities for future adaptation.

The purpose of this study is to scan the existing literature on sports policy, then examine the challenges and opportunities to integrate sports education at the grassroots.
