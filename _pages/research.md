While sports in India have evolved in the past decade, the implementation of the sports policy leaves a lot to be desired. With 26% of the population below the age of 14, amounting to 338 million students at the grassroots, the institutions play a crucial role in implementing mass participation in sport. The purpose of this study is to scan the existing literature on sports policy, then examine the challenges and opportunities to integrate sports education at the grassroots.
