What do Athletes and Employees  have in common?  Both focus on goal-setting,  strategy and execution. With dual careers in Corporate and Sport for 27 years, and am passionate about transforming managers to leaders!

**Executive Coaching?**  
The International Coaching Federation defines coaching as *"Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential."*  

**Coaching Areas**  
*Goal-setting, Strategy, Communication, Project Management*    
As an Executive Fellow Coach at BetterUp (a U.S. based organization), I currently work with corporate managers and leaders across the globe. 

**Client Testimonials**  

*Coach Vijay brought a very structured approach to leadership development and tailored it to my character traits, aspirations, and pace. He often used sports or endurance metaphors to make his point. I see a positive change in my leadership style, and I feel better prepared for the challenges.* <br>
**Director, Technology (India)**

*Vijay has an incredible amount of knowledge and experience, he coached me through developing a commanderâ€™s call speech that truly resonated with my unit. His guidance enabled me to deliver a message that motivated and inspired my team, reinforcing our shared mission and commitment to excellence.* <br>
**Commander at US AirForce**

*I appreciate how Vijay has given me different perspectives and frameworks to use when thinking through things. One thing that stands out what Vijay has reinforced in me is getting up when facing setbacks. He has reiterated through examples how athletes do this and I can totally relate because of my knowledge of sports and me being an athlete as well.* <br>
**Engineering Manager, Technology (USA)**

*Vijay is a seasoned professional who is well-versed with many time-tested models and theories for business management and strategy. His pragmatic approach would help executives think clearly, which helps in better decision making.* <br>
**Director, Technology (Singapore)**   

*Coach Vijay has been a great listening ear, and his thought-provoking questions always prompt me to dig deep and reflect on my inner fears, insecurities, and assumptions. His encouragement and positivity have also helped me to grow throughout the coaching journey.*
**Senior Manager, Marketing (Singapore)** 

*Vijay develops a very easy atmosphere that allows for a discussion of free-flowing thoughts, feelings & ideas, thus making the sessions less like an intervention. I have referred to the example as a fulcrum to reflect even after the interaction. A reasonable amount of reading material was shared to instigate thinking.*
**Director, FMCG (India)**
