**Get Kids to Play**<br>
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Saumil Majmudar**<br>
Get Kids to Play is designed like a Swiss knife and is written with two critical decision-makers in mind – parents and school leaders. Both groups want to get the kids to play but often struggle with the “How?” and get bogged down with obstacles. Eventually, the problem snowballs into a classic case of “Everybody’s baby is nobody’s baby.” Similar to a tool-kit, this book has a range of tools, utilities, and practices to negotiate the various challenges. The five chapters, namely Space, Time, Child, Content, and Facilitator, are organized in such a way that readers can jump to their choice of topic based on their needs.<br>

**EduSports: Extending the Value Proposition**<br>
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. Ram Subramanian**<br>
In mid-September 2022, Saumil Majmudar, the co-founder, chief executive officer, and managing director of Sportz Village faced a problem. The company, based in Bengaluru, India, was India’s leading sports education organization, which provided a structured physical education (PE) curriculum to K–12 schools. Thirteen years after its inception, EduSports, a division of Sportz Village, was unable to reach its goal of penetrating 5,000 schools with its PE curriculum. Research had indicated that the low penetration rate stemmed from not offering inter-school sports competitions to showcase the ability of the students involved in the structured PE program. Majmudar had to evaluate between two funding sources to enable EduSports to offer inter-school sports competitions: pass on the increased subscription price to students or keep the subscription price the same but look for brands to offset the increased costs of running inter-school events. Given that the yearly sales cycle would begin in about two weeks, Majmudar’s decision was urgent. <br> *Publisher* : **https://store.hbr.org/product/edusports-extending-the-value-proposition/W34880**.<br> 

**What elements of the opening set influence the outcome of a tennis match? An in-depth analysis of Wimbledon data**<br>  by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Kapil Gupta, Dr. Soudeep Deb (IIM Bangalore)**  
This study examines the importance of game elements of the first set in Wimbledon matches in deciding the match outcome. We propose a LASSO-induced logistic regression model based on first set data to identify the variables that impact the match outcome. Our findings indicate that winning service points, average distance travelled, and rating points significantly impact match outcome. Additionally, we show the effectiveness of our proposed model in within-match forecasting during the first set, and it frequently performs better than other statistical and machine-learning approaches. We also discuss important managerial applications of our methodology for players, coaches, and other stakeholders. <br> *Publisher* : **https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0970389624000089** <br>

**Public-private partnership in the sports sector: a scan of the extant literature on the policy environment, global perspectives, and projects implemented by other sectors in India** <br> 
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. M.R.Suresh, SDMIMD Mysore**<br>
The recent success of Indian athletes at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics has been attributed to the collaboration of several stakeholders in the sports eco-system namely the Government, private companies, and non-profit organizations. By reviewing the relevant literature, the study aims to provide managerial implications on how State Governments across India can develop a framework for implementing the PPP model within the sports sector.<br>

**Striving towards Badminton for All: a Sports Endeavour at the Grassroots by Padukone Sports Management** <br>
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. M.R.Suresh, SDMIMD Mysore**<br> 
Padukone Sports Management (PSM) is an organization that provides badminton coaching at the grassroots level across India. With its headquarters in Bangalore, PSM operated in 11 different geographic locations, including a mix of Tier-1/2/3 cities and towns. Sriharsha Bade, the General Manager at Padukone Sports Management, had several challenges to address to scale up the badminton program at the grassroots level. While the expansion of the business was a key focus area during the pre-Covid times (2016- 2019), the organization faced existential issues at some of its centres during the Covid pandemic (2020) onwards. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic had been severe on the sports sector, yet badminton popularity continued to increase, primarily due to the consistent performance of the Indian players on the world stage. The challenges included the supply of coaches, access to infrastructure, managing customer expectations, and developing sustainable strategies for Tier-2/3 cities. Therefore, Sriharsha had to closely examine the potential options for the respective challenges. And by doing so, Padukone Sports Management can strive towards fulfilling the endeavour of Badminton for All at the grassroots level.

Title*: **GoSports Foundation: Going Beyond The Gold**  
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. Sanjeev Tripathi, IIM Indore**<br>
GoSports Foundation is a non-profit venture that developed India’s emerging athletic talent through athletic scholarships and other supports that helped the athletes achieve sports excellence. The foundation had limited funding and numerous applicants, requiring that it carefully choose the athletes it would support. Nandan Kamath, a co-founder of the organization, has to choose one athlete from several applicants for support. He also has to decide whether the foundation should start supporting the development of coaches and trainers and how it should balance its support with a desire to advance the profile of athletes competing in the Paralympics.

**Implementation of the Sports Policy in India: A scan of extant literature and Conceptual Framework**<br>   
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. M.R.Suresh, SDMIMD Mysore**<br>  
While sports in India have evolved in the past decade, the implementation of the sports policy leaves a lot to be desired. With 26% of the population below the age of 14, amounting to 338 million students at the grassroots, the institutions play a crucial role in implementing mass participation in sport. The purpose of this study is to scan the existing literature on sports policy, then examine the challenges and opportunities to integrate sports education at the grassroots.

**Performance Management in Non-Profit Sports Organizations using Balanced Scorecard**  
by **Vijay Krishnamurthy, Dr. M.R.Suresh, SDMIMD Mysore**<br> 
The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodology is a widely accepted tool to manage performance in for-profit organizations. Although the BSC has been adapted for non-profit organizations, the relevance and applicability of the tool specific to India's sports sector remain an unexplored area. The purpose of this study is to scan the existing literature on the usage of BSC in managing the performance of non-profit sports organizations, then examine the challenges and opportunities for future adaptation.
