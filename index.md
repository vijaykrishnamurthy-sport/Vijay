Welcome to my website, a place that captures the work I do.

Back in 1997 when I graduated from college, if anyone had told me that I would
travel around the world, navigate through multiple careers, and enjoy work every day, I
wouldâ€™ve laughed it off as a good joke.

A journey that traversed from microprocessors to lawn tennis, set-top-box design to sports
academies, California to Karnataka, Corporate to Entrepreneurship to Academia, and electronics engineering to
Ph.D. in sports management!

So, here I am.

I research, consult, teach, coach, and write for a living.
