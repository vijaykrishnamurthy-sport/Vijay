Two decades ago (1997) when I graduated from college, if anyone had told me that I would
travel around the world, navigate through multiple careers, and enjoy work every day, I
wouldâ€™ve laughed it off as a good joke.

A journey that traversed from microprocessors to lawn tennis, from set-top-box design to sports
academies, from New Jersey and California to Karnataka, and from electronics engineering to
Ph.D. research in sports management!

So here I am.

I research, consult, teach, coach, and write for a living.
Welcome to my personal website, a place that captures all my professional work.
